## Intuitionistic modal Logic and Applications (IMLA)

These meetings were organized to cover the breadth of intuitionistic modal logics and applications, especially applications to computing and modal type theory. I was involved in organizing all, but the [first IMLA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19uzF7Ld2J63UGeiHUe6n7QEPwCqN19N1ucz3VXZUHa0/edit?tab=t.0) in 1999. 

We can read why I think this is important in the blog posts: [Why Constructive Modal Logics?](https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/2012/09/why-constructive-modal-logics.html) and [Wayback Machine, I love you! IMLA 1999 ](https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/2012/10/wayback-machine-i-love-you-imla-1999.html).
Here are some descriptions of the workshops and their published results.

* **Proceedings of the [5th Workshop on Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications (IMLA 2011)]()** The Invited Speakers were Frank Pfenning and Torben Brauner. I believe the organizers were Aleks Nanevski and me, as per this [technical report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/tr-2008-90.pdf), but I'm not sure. The post-meeting [special issue of Information and Computation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089054011100143X?via%3Dihub), covering both IMLA2008 and IMLA2005, was edited by Brigitte Pientka and Valeria de Paiva.
